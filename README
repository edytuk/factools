factools
--------
A repository of tools for GlideinWMS Factory Operations

Repo Overview
-------------
Scripts are sorted into two types of directories:
- generic/ - contains scripts that can be used at any factory without
modification.
- <factory name>/ - (e.g. UCSD/, GOC-ITB/, etc) contains scripts that have
hardcoded values dependent on the factory it was developed for.

Ultimately the goal is to make all scripts eventually become generic and move
away from the factory specific dirs.  Scripts in generic/ may also become
possible candidates to be contributed back to glideinWMS.

Usage
-----
In this document and other READMEs $FACTOOLS is used for installation location.

To install the repo and make the scripts available in a working factory:
1. clone the repo:
git clone git://github.com/jdost321/factools.git

2. edit .bash_profile for factory user (likely gfactory) and add:
export PATH=$FACTOOLS/generic/bin/:$PATH

3. create $FACTOOLS/etc/factools-env.sh and define some env vars:
export GLIDEIN_MAIL_REPLY_TO=<email to put in Reply-to: field of reports>
export GLIDEIN_FACTORY_NAME=<factory name to appear in reports> # optional
export GLIDEIN_MON_URL=<url of current factory instance monitor dir>

4. add the following to .bash_profile:
. /opt/factools/etc/factools-env.sh

5. check doc/ dir for tool specific READMEs and follow further instructions
